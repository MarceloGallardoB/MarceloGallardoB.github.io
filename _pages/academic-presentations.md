    Seminar for the Winter School 2023 organized by the Association of Students and Alumni of Mathematics and the Association of Physics Students of PUCP.  
    Based on Alfred Galichon's book, *Optimal Transport Methods in Economics*, and his co-authored paper *SISTA: Learning Optimal Transport Costs Under Sparsity Constraints*.

* **On the Conference Paper [Finding a Walrasian Equilibrium is Easy for a Fixed Number of Agents](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~fechenique/published/sperner.pdf) by [F. Echenique](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~fechenique/index.html) and [A. Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/)**  
  _For Numerical Analysis, Mathematics PUCP_

    As part of the midterm assignment for the course *Numerical Analysis (2024-2)*, I presented the article *Finding a Walrasian Equilibrium is Easy for a Finite Number of Agents* by Federico Echenique and Adam Wierman.  
    The article introduces an algorithm that computes, in polynomial time with respect to the number of goods and a parameter epsilon, an epsilon-Walrasian equilibrium.  
    In my presentation, I delved into some of the technical details and provided a comprehensive introduction for those unfamiliar with general equilibrium theory.  
    I also proposed some insights on one of the lemmas discussed in the article.
