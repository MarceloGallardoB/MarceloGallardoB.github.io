About Me
======

Mathematician from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) with a concentration in economics ([CV here](https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/cv_mg.pdf)). I am also a teaching and research assistant. My research interests include Consumer Theory, Matching Theory, Optimal Control, and Optimal Transport applied to Economics.

I recently co-authored two books on applied mathematics for economics and four papersâ€”two in my fields of microeconomic theory and matching, and two empirical studies using cross-sectional, time-series, and machine learning techniques. 

I am currently submitting my work and preparing applications for postgraduate studies in Economics (2025).
