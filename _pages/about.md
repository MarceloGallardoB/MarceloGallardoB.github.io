About Me
======

I am a fourth year student at PUCP majoring in Mathematics and minoring (choice courses) in Economics. I was also teaching assistant of Mathematics for Economists IV and currently research assistant. I am broadly interested in Convex Optimization, Microeconomic Theory, Optimal Control and Optimal Transport applied to Economics. I would like to go deeper into Quantitative Methods. This last includes Statistics, Econometrics and Machine Learning. Most of my research projects focus on applied mathematics to economics. Currently working in two books, one about Optimization and Convex Analysis and the other about Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control Theory for the economic analysis in continuous time.
