About Me
======

I am a fourth-year student at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Economics. I am also a teaching and research assistant. 

I am broadly interested in Convex Optimization, Microeconomic Theory, Optimal Control, and Optimal Transport applied to Economics.

I am currently working on two books, one about Optimization and Convex Analysis, and the other about Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control Theory for economic analysis in continuous time, two working papers and my thesis. 

For more information about my background, please refer to [my CV](https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
