About Me
======

I am a fifth-year student at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Economics. I am also a teaching and research assistant. 

I am broadly interested in Microeconomic Theory, Matching Theory, Economic Growth Convex Optimization, Optimal Control, and Optimal Transport applied to Economics.

I am currently involved in several academic endeavors, including my thesis, two working papers, and a book on Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control Theory in continuous time for Economics. At the beginning of 2024, I concluded writing a book, for which I am a co-author, on Optimization and Convex Analysis with applications in microeconomics. We are awaiting its publication.
