About Me
======

I am a fourth-year student at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Economics. I was also a teaching assistant for 'Mathematics for Economists IV', and I am currently working as a research assistant. 

I am broadly interested in Convex Optimization, Microeconomic Theory, Optimal Control, and Optimal Transport applied to Economics. I would like to go deeper into Quantitative Methods. This includes Statistics, Econometrics, and Machine Learning. 

I am currently working on two books, one about Optimization and Convex Analysis, and the other about Dynamical Systems and Optimal Control Theory for economic analysis in continuous time.

For more information about my background and qualifications, please refer to [my CV](https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
