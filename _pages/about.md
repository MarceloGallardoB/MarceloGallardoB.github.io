I am a Ph.D. student majoring in [Social and Engineering Systems](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/) at MIT IDSS and CSAIL. I have been fortunately working with [Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/) on Machine Learning for Healthcare (ML4H), with a particular focus on Healthy Natural Language Processing (HealthyNLP).

My research centers around two primary questions:
* How can we mitigate the effects of spurious correlations in language models, which are often trained on biased real-world data and can produce unequal results for different demographic groups?
* How can we accurately quantify the uncertainty associated with the outputs of language models, enabling decision-makers to make more informed choices in high-stakes applications?

I am actively compiling a list of relevant HealthyNLP papers, which can be found via [this link](https://github.com/xiaoyuxin1002/AwesomeHealthyNLP).
