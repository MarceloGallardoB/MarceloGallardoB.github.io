    </summary> This study examines the impact of political uncertainty on key macroeconomic variables, including the USD to  PEN exchange rate, through a specialized index built from social media analysis. Tweets from prominent Peruvian figures (2018-2023) are analyzed and labeled by GPT-3.5 Turbo, determining their stance on Peru's political and economic situation. This process contributes to the creation of a political uncertainty time series. This series, indicative of Peru's economic climate, is integrated with a (chosen macroeconomic forecasting method) to enhance the prediction of macroeconomic trends, with a focus on currency exchange dynamics.

    </summary>
   This paper proposes an innovation indicator for Peruvian universities, emphasizing scientific innovation in fields like engineering and pure sciences. The construction of this indicator is based on a selected dataset and employs confirmatory factor analysis for robust measurement. Additionally, K-means clustering is used to identify innovation clusters among universities. The validity of the indicator is examined through its correlation with university rankings and the exploration of the relationship between innovation levels and post-graduation income. This study provides a focused lens on scientific innovation in higher education, offering insights into academic and policy implications in Peru.

    </summary> We develop a path towards the proof of Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem, although based on several sources, of our construction. We also present an application in economic theory. Specifically, we focus on general equilibrium theory. We aim to provide the simplest possible proof, the only requirements are real analysis and general topology. Besides one Lemma which is not proved in its most general case, we provide proofs for all the results building up to the main theorem. Furthermore, as far as we know, the combination of elements that we present in this document has not been displayed in this exact form before. It is important to mention that this work does not seek to be original or innovative in the sense that it does not present any new results in the literature. Our objective is simply to develop an understandable approach to Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem and its applications in general equilibrium.
