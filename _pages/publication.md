   This paper proposes an innovation indicator for Peruvian universities, emphasizing scientific innovation in fields like engineering and pure sciences. The construction of this indicator is based on a selected dataset and employs confirmatory factor analysis for robust measurement. Additionally, K-means clustering is used to identify innovation clusters among universities. The validity of the indicator is examined through its correlation with university rankings and the exploration of
the relationship between innovation levels and post-graduation income. This study provides a focused lens on scientific innovation in higher education, offering insights for academic and policy implications in Peru.

    </summary>
   We develop a path towards the proof of Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem, although based on several sources, of our construction. We also present an application in economic theory. Specifically, we focus on general equilibrium theory. We aim to provide the simplest possible proof, the only requirements are real analysis and general topology. Besides one Lemma which is not proved in its most general case, we provide proofs for all the results building up to the main theorem. Furthermore, as far as
we know, that the combination of elements that we present in this document has not been displayed in this exact form before. The applications that
we provide in general equilibrium, besides classical definitions, are by our constructions, especially one last example that has been developed by our
own.
