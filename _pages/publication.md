        Abstract |
        <a href="https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/twitter_political_indicator_page_1.pdf" role="button" target="_blank"> Working paper </a> | 
    </summary> This study examines the impact of political uncertainty on key macroeconomic variables, including the USD to  PEN exchange rate, through a specialized index built from social media analysis. Tweets from prominent Peruvian figures (2018-2023) are analyzed and labeled by GPT-3.5 Turbo, determining their stance on Peru's political and economic situation. This process contributes to the creation of a political uncertainty time series. This series, indicative of Peru's economic climate, is integrated with a (chosen macroeconomic forecasting method) to enhance the prediction of macroeconomic trends, with a focus on currency exchange dynamics.

* Introduction to econometrics <br>
  <u>Marcelo Gallardo</u> and Juan Leon. <br>
  <details> 
    <summary>
        Summary |
        <a href="https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/lecture_notes_econometrics.pdf" role="button" target="_blank"> Lecture Notes </a> | 
    </summary> These lecture notes offer a deep dive into econometrics, structured around key themes from matrix algebra basics to sophisticated statistical models. The content begins with foundational matrix operations and their relevance to econometrics, advancing to static optimization, and exploring multivariate models with a focus on linear models and optimization issues. It also addresses qualitative variables, sampling methods, and experimental designs. Crucial econometric challenges such as multicollinearity, parameter stability, heteroscedasticity, and serial autocorrelation are thoroughly examined, alongside detection and correction techniques. The notes culminate in discussions on more advanced topics like maximum likelihood estimation and limited dependent variable, equipping readers with a broad understanding of econometric analysis and application.

* Brouwer fixed point theorem and applications in general equilibrium <br>

        Summary |
        <a href="https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/brouwer_fixed_point_theorem.pdf" role="button" target="_blank"> Lecture Notes </a> | 
    </summary> We develop a path towards the proof of Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem. We also present an application in economic theory: the existence of the Walrasian Equilibrium. We aim to provide the simplest. or at least one of the simplest, proof for Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem. The only requirements are real analysis and general topology. Besides one Lemma which is not proved in its most general case, we prove all the results building up to the main theorem. It is important to emphasize that this work does not seek to be original or innovative, we do not introduce any new results in the literature. Our goal is to develop a clear and understandable approach to Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem and its applications in general equilibrium.
