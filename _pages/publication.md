* Congestion and Penalization in Discrete Matching <br>
 Marcelo Gallardo,   [Jorge Chávez](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/profesor/jorge-chavez-fuentes) and [Manuel Loaiza](https://github.com/ManuelLoaizaVasquez). <br>
 <details>    <summary> Abstract |<a href="" role="button" target="_blank"> Draft coming soon </a> | 
</summary> This paper presents two models inspired by optimal transport, integrating a congestion factor into their cost structures. The first model modifies the classic transport problem by including congestion, and the second model introduces weighting and penalization terms instead of typical constraints. We provide theoretical insights and simulations, including the analysis of interior or corner solutions, and comparative statics. Our findings highlight the potential of these models for future research in preference or cost estimation in matching markets.

* Harnessing Twitter and GPT for a Novel Political Uncertainty Index for Peru: Implications for USD/PEN Exchange Rate Fluctuations <br>

        <a href="https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/twitter_political_indicator_page_1.pdf" role="button" target="_blank"> Working paper </a> | 
    </summary> This study examines the impact of political uncertainty on key macroeconomic variables, including the USD to  PEN exchange rate, through a specialized index built from social media analysis. Tweets from prominent Peruvian figures (2018-2023) are analyzed and labeled by GPT-3.5 Turbo, determining their stance on Peru's political and economic situation. This process contributes to the creation of a political uncertainty time series. This series, indicative of Peru's economic climate, is integrated with a (chosen macroeconomic forecasting method to be determined) to enhance the prediction of macroeconomic trends, with a focus on currency exchange dynamics.

        <a href="https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/innovation_peruvian_universities-abstract.pdf" role="button" target="_blank"> Working paper </a> | 
    </summary> This paper proposes an innovation indicator for Peruvian universities, emphasizing scientific innovation in fields like engineering and pure sciences. The construction of this indicator is based on a selected dataset and employs confirmatory factor analysis for robust measurement. Additionally, $K$-means clustering is used to identify innovation clusters among universities. The validity of the indicator is examined through its correlation with university rankings and the exploration of the relationship between innovation levels and post-graduation income and overeducation. This study provides a focused lens on scientific innovation in higher education, offering insights for academic and policy implications in Peru.

        Summary |
        <a href="https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/lecture_notes_teoria_econometrica.pdf" role="button" target="_blank"> Lecture Notes </a> | 
    </summary> These lecture notes offer a deep dive into econometrics, structured around key themes from matrix algebra basics to statistical models. The content begins with foundational matrix operations and their relevance to econometrics, advancing to static optimization, and exploring multivariate models with a focus on linear models and optimization issues. It also addresses qualitative variables, sampling methods, and experimental designs. Crucial econometric challenges such as multicollinearity, parameter stability, heteroscedasticity, and serial autocorrelation are thoroughly examined, alongside detection and correction techniques. The notes culminate in discussions on more advanced topics like instrumental variables, maximum likelihood estimation, and an appendix on probability theory, equipping readers with a broad understanding of econometric analysis and application.
