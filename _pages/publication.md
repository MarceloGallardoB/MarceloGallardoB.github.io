* [Congestion and Penalization in Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07363) - Under review <br>
[Marcelo Gallardo](https://marcelogallardob.github.io/),  [Manuel Loaiza](https://github.com/ManuelLoaizaVasquez) and [Jorge Chávez](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/profesor/jorge-chavez-fuentes). <br>
  <details>    <summary> Abstract |<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5025651" role="button" target="_blank">Pre-print </a> | 
    </summary> In this paper we introduce two novel models derived from the discrete optimal transport problem. The first model extends the traditional transport problem by adding a quadratic congestion factor directly into the cost function, while the second model replaces conventional constraints with weighted penalization terms. We present theoretical results, for the characterization of interior and corner solution for some specific cases, and we perform smooth comparative statics analysis. We also propose an O((N+L)(NL)2) algorithm for computing the optimal plan for the penalized model assuming interior solutions. Pre-print in arXiv differs slightly from the last version in SSRN.  </details>  

* Irregular wave dynamics driven by a random force within the Burgers equation - Submitted <br>
Marcelo Gallardo and [Marcelo Flamarion](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/profesor/marcelo-velloso-flamarion-vasconcellos-). <br>
  <details>     <summary> Abstract |<a href="https://tcam.sbmac.org.br/tema" role="button" target="_blank"> Pre-print under request </a> | 
    </summary> In this article, we study the classical Burgers equation as a model for random fields. First, we consider initial data defined as a sum of harmonics with random phases and compute the blow-up time. Several simulations are performed, revealing that, while the critical blow-up time is approximately distributed according to a Gaussian law, the statistical tests reject the normality hypothesis. For the viscous case, we analyze waves driven by a random force. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the averaged wave field is computed numerically. Through a change of variables, we demonstrate that randomness primarily affects the phase of the wave field. Assuming the phase follows a uniform distribution, we show that the averaged field spreads and diminishes over time.

* New: X political and economic uncertainty index for Peru <br>

        <a href="" role="button" target="_blank"> Working paper </a> | 
    </summary> In this paper we construct and examine the impact of political-economic uncertainty on key macroeconomic variables, focusing on the Lima Stock Exchange (BVL) and the USD/PEN exchange rate. The construction of the uncertainty index is based on social media analysis, using tweets from influential Peruvian figures (2018-2023). These tweets are analyzed and classified by GPT-3.5 Turbo to assess their stance on Peru’s political and economic situation, generating a political-economic uncertainty time series. The aggregation is performed following novel machine learning techniques. We then test the correlation between this index, BVL returns, and exchange rate fluctuations. To capture the effects of uncertainty on market volatility, we consider GARCH models, which allow for a robust analysis of conditional variance dynamics.

        <a href="https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/innovation_peruvian_universities-abstract.pdf" role="button" target="_blank"> Working paper </a> | 
    </summary> This paper proposes an innovation indicator for Peruvian universities, focusing on scientific innovation in fields such as engineering and pure sciences. The indicator is constructed using a selected dataset and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to ensure robust measurement, with Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) used to validate the model fit. K-means clustering is applied to identify innovation clusters among universities. Its validity is examined through standard correlation with university rankings and econometric analysis linking the indicator with wage per hour and overeducation. To address potential sample selection bias, we implement a Heckman two-step correction, incorporating the inverse Mills ratio (IMR) into the wage equation. Additionally, we correct for heteroscedasticity by employing heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors (HC3) and assess model reliability through diagnostic tests such as the Breusch-Pagan and White tests.

        <a href="https://MarceloGallardoB.github.io/files/lecture_notes_teoria_econometrica.pdf" role="button" target="_blank"> Lecture Notes </a> | 
    </summary> Very preliminary, R&R for Decon PUCP. These lecture notes offer a deep dive into econometrics, structured around key themes from matrix algebra basics to statistical models. The content begins with foundational matrix operations and their relevance to econometrics, advancing to static optimization, and exploring multivariate models with a focus on linear models and optimization issues. It also addresses qualitative variables, sampling methods, and experimental designs. Crucial econometric challenges such as multicollinearity, parameter stability, heteroscedasticity, and serial autocorrelation are thoroughly examined, alongside detection and correction techniques. The notes culminate in discussions on more advanced topics like instrumental variables, maximum likelihood estimation, and an appendix on probability theory, equipping readers with a broad understanding of econometric analysis and application. New: second version will include more examples and an introduction to time series.

      </summary> As part of the midterm assignment for the course Numerical Analysis (2024-2), I presented the article Finding a Walrasian Equilibrium is Easy for a Finite Number of Agents by Federico Echenique and Adam Wierman. The article introduces an algorithm that computes, in polynomial time with respect to the number of goods and a parameter epsilon, an epsilon-Walrasian equilibrium. In my presentation, I delved into some of the technical details and provided a comprehensive introduction for those unfamiliar with general equilibrium theory. I also proposed some insights on one of the lemmas discussed in the article.
