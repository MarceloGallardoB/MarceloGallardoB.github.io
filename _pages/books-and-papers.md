## Completed Papers

* [Congestion and Penalization in Optimal Transport]({{ "/files/books-and-papers/alternative-unconstrained-penalized-matching.pdf" | relative_url }}) - Under review  
  [Marcelo Gallardo]({{ "/" | relative_url }}), [Manuel Loaiza](https://github.com/ManuelLoaizaVasquez), and [Jorge Chávez](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/profesor/jorge_chavez_fuentes).

    In this paper, we introduce two novel models derived from the discrete optimal transport problem. The first model extends the traditional transport problem by adding a quadratic congestion factor directly into the cost function, while the second model replaces conventional constraints with weighted penalization terms. We present theoretical results and perform comparative statics analysis. We also propose an O((N+L)(NL)2) algorithm for computing the optimal plan for the penalized model assuming interior solutions. Pre-print in arXiv differs slightly from the last version in [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5025651).

* **Irregular wave dynamics driven by a random force within the Burgers equation** - Submitted

    <summary>Abstract | <a href="https://tcam.sbmac.org.br/tema" target="_blank">Pre-print under request</a></summary>
    This article studies the classical Burgers equation as a model for random fields. Several simulations reveal that while the critical blow-up time is approximately distributed according to a Gaussian law, statistical tests reject the normality hypothesis.

* **Novel innovation indicator for Peruvian universities** - Under review  
  Marcelo Gallardo and [Juan Leon Jara-Almonte](https://www.grade.org.pe/en/investigadores/personal/jleon/).  
  <details>
    <summary>Abstract | <a href="{{ "/files/books-and-papers/innovation_peruvian_universities.pdf" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Working paper</a></summary>
    This paper proposes an innovation indicator for Peruvian universities, focusing on scientific innovation in fields such as engineering and pure sciences. The indicator is constructed using Scopus, TUNI, Sunedu, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to ensure robust measurement.
