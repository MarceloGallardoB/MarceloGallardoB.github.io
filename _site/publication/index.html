                In this paper we introduce two novel models derived from the
                discrete optimal transport problem. The first model extends the
                traditional transport problem by adding a quadratic congestion
                factor directly into the cost function, while the second model
                replaces conventional constraints with weighted penalization
                terms. We present theoretical results, for the characterization
                of interior and corner solution for some specific cases, and we
                perform smooth comparative statics analysis. We also propose an
                O((N+L)(NL)2) algorithm for computing the optimal plan for the
                penalized model assuming interior solutions. Pre-print in arXiv
                differs slightly from the last version in SSRN.

                In this article, we study the classical Burgers equation as a
                model for random fields. First, we consider initial data defined
                as a sum of harmonics with random phases and compute the blow-up
                time. Several simulations are performed, revealing that, while
                the critical blow-up time is approximately distributed according
                to a Gaussian law, the statistical tests reject the normality
                hypothesis. For the viscous case, we analyze waves driven by a
                random force. Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the averaged
                wave field is computed numerically. Through a change of
                variables, we demonstrate that randomness primarily affects the
                phase of the wave field. Assuming the phase follows a uniform
                distribution, we show that the averaged field spreads and
                diminishes over time.

                This paper proposes an innovation indicator for Peruvian
                universities, focusing on scientific innovation in fields such
                as engineering and pure sciences. The indicator is constructed
                using a selected dataset (Scopus, TUNI, Sunedu) and confirmatory
                factor analysis (CFA) to ensure robust measurement, with
                Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) used to
                validate the model fit. K-means clustering is applied to
                identify innovation clusters among universities. The validity of
                the indicator is examined through standard correlation with
                university rankings and econometric analysis linking the
                indicator with wage per hour and simple overeducation. To
                address potential sample selection bias, we implement a Heckman
                two-step correction, incorporating the inverse Mills ratio (IMR)
                into the wage equation. Additionally, we correct for
                heteroscedasticity by employing heteroscedasticity-robust
                standard errors (HC3). For this work, we used ENAHO modules
                200-500.

                </summary>
                In this paper, we build upon the optimal transport quadratic
                regularization model to develop a framework that incorporates
                congestion costs, particularly in matching within the healthcare
                and education sectors. Specifically, we introduce a model with
                heterogeneous quadratic costs. We analyze the model's properties
                under specific cases, extending the existing literature.
                Furthermore, we explore key structural characteristics of the
                model and provide numerical examples illustrating why this
                formulation more accurately captures real-world phenomena,
                particularly in the Peruvian context. The main result consists
                of identifying a specific type of corner solution when matching
                the same number of clusters, i.e., N=L.

                </summary>
                In this paper, we focus on developing a new political-economic
                uncertainty index based on tweets from influential figures in
                Peruvian politics and economics with accounts on Twitter (now X)
                from 2018 to 2023. These tweets are analyzed and classified
                using GPT-3.5 Turbo to determine their stance on Peru’s
                political and economic landscape, generating a time series of
                political-economic uncertainty. The aggregation process employs
                novel machine learning techniques to enhance the robustness of
                the index. To evaluate the impact of this index, we conduct time
                series and count-based econometric analyses using key
                macroeconomic variables, such as the Lima Stock Exchange (BVL)
                returns and the USD/PEN exchange rate.

                </summary>
                We build on Martinelli and Xiao (2024) by introducing a new
                model of duopolistic competition that incorporates seller cost
                uncertainty and advertising. Unlike Martinelli and Xiao (2024),
                our model explicitly includes advertising as a decision
                variable, leading to a more intricate yet realistic formulation
                of expected demand. This extension captures the impact of
                advertising expenditures by each firm, adding a crucial
                strategic dimension to the analysis. Although our model is
                formulated for an arbitrary positive integer number of firms,
                most of our analysis focuses on the case of two firms, placing
                it within the framework of a duopoly. This choice is driven by
                the algebraic complexity introduced by advertising, which
                significantly complicates the transition to a more general
                setting. We examine two scenarios: one where advertising is
                exogenous, limiting the optimization to pricing decisions, and
                another where advertising is treated as an endogenous strategic
                variable. For the exogenous case with

                These lecture notes offer a deep dive into econometrics,
                structured around key themes from matrix algebra basics to
                statistical models. The content begins with foundational matrix
                operations and their relevance to econometrics, advancing to the
                multivariate models with a focus on linear models and
                optimization issues. It also addresses qualitative variables,
                sampling methods, and experimental designs. Crucial econometric
                challenges such as multicollinearity, parameter stability,
                heteroscedasticity, and serial autocorrelation are thoroughly
                examined, alongside detection and correction techniques. The
                notes culminate in discussions on more advanced topics like
                instrumental variables, maximum likelihood estimation, and an
                appendix on probability theory, equipping readers with a broad
                understanding of econometric analysis and application. New:
                second version will include more examples and an introduction to
                time series.

                This document discusses applications of optimal transport theory
                in economics and finance, with a focus on computational methods
                like entropic regularization and the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm.
                It covers topics such as matching markets stability, cost
                structure estimation, Credit Value Adjustment, and risk
                measures, aiming to provide detailed explanations and
                translations of complex results for students with a strong
                mathematical background. The document includes an appendix to
                support understanding and is intended for advanced students
                interested in economic and financial applications of optimal
                transport.

                We develop a path towards the proof of Brouwer's Fixed Point
                Theorem. We also present an application in economic theory: the
                existence of the Walrasian Equilibrium. We aim to provide the
                simplest, or at least one of the simplest, proofs for Brouwer's
                Fixed Point Theorem. The only requirements are real analysis and
                general topology. Besides one Lemma which is not proved in its
                most general case, we prove all the results building up to the
                main theorem. It is important to emphasize that this work does
                not introduce any new results in the literature. Our goal is to
                develop a clear and understandable approach to Brouwer's Fixed
                Point Theorem and its applications in general equilibrium.

                As part of the midterm assignment for the course Numerical
                Analysis (2024-2), I presented the article Finding a Walrasian
                Equilibrium is Easy for a Finite Number of Agents by Federico
                Echenique and Adam Wierman. The article introduces an algorithm
                that computes, in polynomial time with respect to the number of
                goods and a parameter epsilon, an epsilon-Walrasian equilibrium.
                In my presentation, I delved into some of the technical details
                and provided a comprehensive introduction for those unfamiliar
                with general equilibrium theory. I also proposed some insights
                on one of the lemmas discussed in the article.
